# Maze solver
A Small Size Robot (10cm * 15cm) which can solve the maze

Components : Arduino uno , 3 Ultrasonic Sensor(SR04)  

Code: Use Left Hand Rule (LHR) 

Efficency: Not that much efficient when it is in a Critical Maze which have lots of loop in it

Future Plan:Try to use better algorithm in future or ML to make it more efficient
