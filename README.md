# Maze solver(Micro_Mouse)
A Small Size Robot (10cm * 15cm) which can solve the maze

Components : Arduino uno , 3 Ultrasonic Sensor(SR04) or 6 IR Sensor, BO motro(200rpm) , Motor Driver(L293D) , 3D Printed Body Parts(Whole Chassis) , LI Battery(3.7v * 2)  

Code: Use Left Hand Rule (LHR) 

Efficiency: Not that much efficient when it is in a Critical Maze which have lots of loop in it

Future Plan:Try to use better algorithm in future or ML to make it more efficient
